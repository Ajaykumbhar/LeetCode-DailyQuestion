## 2616. Minimize the Maximum Difference of Pairs | Link <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/"><img src="https://leetcode.com/_next/static/images/logo-dark-c96c407d175e36c81e236fcfdd682a0b.png" alt="LeetCode Logo" width="18"> </a>

### Approach: Binary Search + Greedy Pairing

#### Why?
 - Binary search is employed to efficiently narrow down the search space for the minimum maximum difference.
 - Greedy pairing helps in counting the number of pairs that can be formed within a certain maximum difference.
