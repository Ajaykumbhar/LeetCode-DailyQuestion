## DP-Notes:

### Identifying whether a problem can be solved using dynamic programming (DP):

- Here are some common characteristics and approaches to look for when trying to determine if a problem might have a DP solution:

  #### 1. <u>Optimal Substructure:</u>
  
     - DP problems often involve breaking down a larger problem into smaller subproblems. If the optimal solution to the larger problem can be constructed from optimal solutions to its subproblems, it's a good indicator that DP might be applicable.


  #### 2. **Overlapping Subproblems:**
  
     - Look for patterns where the same subproblems are solved multiple times. If solving these subproblems repeatedly can       be avoided by storing and reusing their solutions, DP is likely a good fit.

  #### 3. **Memoization and Tabulation:**
  
    - DP can be approached using either the top-down approach (memoization) or the bottom-up approach (tabulation). The       problem might lend itself to one of these approaches, which involves storing solutions in a data structure (like an array) to avoid redundant          calculations.


  #### 4. **Counting or Optimization:**
  
  - DP is often used for problems involving counting possibilities, optimizing a value (minimizing or maximizing), or       finding the number of ways to achieve a certain outcome.


  #### 5. **Breaking Down Problem:**
    - If you can break down a problem into smaller subproblems that are related and can help you build the solution for the       larger problem, DP might be a good approach.


  #### 6. **Recursive Structure:**
    - Problems that naturally have a recursive structure, where the solution for a larger instance depends on the solutions         for smaller instances, often suggest a DP approach.


  #### 7. **Memoization Opportunities:**
    - If you notice that you're solving the same problem multiple times or that you're making similar recursive calls,       it's a sign that DP could be beneficial to store and reuse these solutions.


  #### 8. **Combinatorial Problems:**
    - Problems involving combinations, permutations, or ways to arrange or select elements often have DP solutions.


  #### 9. **Pathfinding and Sequences:**
    - Problems related to finding paths, sequences, or arrangements can often be tackled using DP.


  #### 10. **Dependency on Previous Steps:**
    - If the problem requires making decisions at each step based on the previous steps' results, DP might be a           suitable approach.

#### Remember, identifying DP solutions becomes easier with practice. It's helpful to study and solve various DP problems to become familiar with the patterns and techniques commonly used. As you gain experience, you'll develop an intuition for recognizing when DP might be applicable to a problem.
