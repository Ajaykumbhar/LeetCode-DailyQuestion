## ‚ú® Comprehensive Bit Manipulation Concepts

### 1. Bitwise Operators

- **AND (`&`)**: Compares each bit of two numbers and returns `1` only when both bits are `1`.
  - [Study Link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bitwise-and-or-xor-not-operators-in-c/)

- **OR (`|`)**: Compares each bit and returns `1` if at least one of the bits is `1`.
  - [Study Link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bitwise-and-or-xor-not-operators-in-c/)

- **NOT (`~`)**: Flips the bits of a number (`1` becomes `0` and `0` becomes `1`).
  - [Study Link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bitwise-and-or-xor-not-operators-in-c/)

- **XOR (`^`)**: Returns `1` if the bits are different, otherwise returns `0`.
  - [Study Link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bitwise-and-or-xor-not-operators-in-c/)

- **Left Shift (`<<`)**: Shifts bits to the left by a certain number of positions, effectively multiplying the number by powers of 2.
  - [Study Link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/left-shift-right-shift-operators-c-cpp/)

- **Right Shift (`>>`)**: Shifts bits to the right by a certain number of positions, effectively dividing the number by powers of 2.
