  Approach used in the code to solve the "Number of Music Playlists" problem step by step:

1. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: The core idea behind this approach is to build a dynamic programming table to keep track of the number of possible playlists of different lengths and using different numbers of songs. By filling up this table iteratively, we can efficiently compute the final answer.

2. **Base Case**: The base case is when the playlist length is 0 and the number of different songs is also 0. In this case, there's only one way to create an empty playlist.

3. **Filling up the DP Table**:
   - We iterate over each playlist length `i` from 1 to `goal` and each possible number of different songs `j` from 1 to the minimum of `i` and `n`.
   - For each `(i, j)` combination, we need to consider two scenarios:
   
     a. **Picking a New Song**:
        - If `j` songs are already chosen in the current playlist of length `i`, we have `n - j + 1` choices for the next song (since we want every song to be played at least once). So, we consider `dp[i - 1][j - 1] * (n - j + 1)` as the number of ways to pick a new song.
        
     b. **Replaying a Song**:
        - If the number of songs already chosen (`j`) is greater than `k`, we can replay any song from the last `k` songs played. In this case, we consider `dp[i - 1][j] * (j - k)` as the number of ways to replay a song.

   - Combine the two scenarios by adding their counts, and make sure to take the result modulo to prevent overflow.

4. **Final Result**:
   - The final result is stored in `dp[goal][n]`, which represents the number of possible playlists of length `goal` using `n` different songs.

5. **Modulo Operation**:
   - To ensure the final result doesn't exceed large integer limits, the modulo operation is applied to the result before returning it. This is a common practice in dynamic programming problems to keep the numbers manageable.
